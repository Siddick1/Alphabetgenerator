# Alphabet generator

I was mentoring a friend of mine to master the English alphabets, I decided to look online for a way on how to generate the English alphabets randomly so that he can pronounce them as soon as they pop-up. But unfortunately I was not able to find a nice alphabet-generator web-app. And that is why I decided to build mine in order to have a nice one!
