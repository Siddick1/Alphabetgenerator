# Alphabet generator

I was mentoring a friend of mine to master the English alphabets, I decided to look for a way online on how to generate the English alphabets randomly so that he can pronounce them as soon as it pops up. But unfortunately I was not able to a nice alphabet generator. And that is why I decided to build mine.
